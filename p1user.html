    <h1><code>P.P1.3: <br> User Scenario Mapping</code></h1>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Scenario</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Shanna is a recent college grduate and plant lover that just started her first full time job as a Graphic Designer. Due to her new job, Shanna does not have a lot of time to take care of plants. She wants a plant to keep her company, that is easy to take care of and does not require a lot of maintenance. Shanna decided to browse online and found  SproutMart, a site that sells lush indoor plants, succulents, and essential gardening tools. She considers the effort needed to care for the plant, the size of the plant, shipping time, warranty, and resources available. Shanna finds a Snake Plant that is low maintenance and adds it to her cart, adds her shipping information and payment information, and places her order.</p>
